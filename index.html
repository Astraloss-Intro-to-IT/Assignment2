        <h1>Project Team</h1>
        <p>-	Description:<br><br>
            + To begin, I will create the app icon in Adobe Photoshop and Adobe Illustrator.
            <br><br>
            + Then, for Android applications, I must use programming languages such as Java or C++, and for iOS apps, I must use Swift or Object-C to ensure that the greatest number of users can approach (Sandamal Siripathi - Jul 24 2017). Making a basic user interface is critical for the majority of my users, who have visual impairments; yet I must also ensure that it loads quickly and runs smoothly.
            <br><br>
            + In order create these apps, many professionals in various fields are needed, including mechatronics, robotics, industrial design, psychology, business development, and before publishing the application to the community, it must go through numerous tests with many blind individuals in order to deliver the best version. This is a revolutionary creation for the blind, so it forces to make no mistakes during the running process because it might be affected to their experience or even their lives. As a start-up, time is the most valuable resources to help us achieve goals and projects for the more time we spend, the more money we will have to consume.
            <br><br>
            +  I am also knowledgeable about AI development since I must allow the computer system to learn from the simplest to the most complicated data and images in order to recognize, analyze, forecast, and provide final findings as quickly as feasible. It has to understand the environment, objects, their position and movement in 3D. Then, virtual assistants transmit information to the blind using auditory impulses. To guarantee the system functions efficiently and properly, a good picture classification algorithm is designed, which needs a lot of individual and technological processes between the live camera video stream and data (Oction n.d.). To handle the input and output data, this will need extensive backend computing, such as massive database management, memory allocation, and powerful hardware interfacing (Kevin Toth - 16 Jan 2017).
            <br><br>
            + In addition, we sometime may encounter some cyber-attacks and malfunction in our system; therefore, we have to train a fast reaction crew to deal with the emergency casualties. Developing strong security systems and firewalls are also important for app improvement for if the hackers gain access to the systems to obtain customer and company information, it will be a huge problem. The disclosure may jeopardize the syndicates' reputation, and their developing, working plan may be copied by opponents. Furthermore, malicious code can be delivered to the organization's system, which will take time to recover from and may affect the important data if timely technical actions are not taken.
            <br><br>
            + Furthermore, because the mobile phone is portable and inseparable, individuals always have it with them; thus, it will now serve as a trustworthy aid for the blinds and visually impaired people.
            <br><br>
            + Unlike other apps, users do not need to click on the app's icon or navigate through the user interface; instead, they will instruct the virtual assistant to turn on the app whenever they require it. The app will then connect and turn on their front camera to process data from a video stream in a radius of 1 meter in front of them to warn of impending risks and objects, and the virtual assistance access the microphone to read it out loud for you. Furthermore, it can identify the color, text as well as handwriting in newspapers, documents, determine the value of the money they paid, and human expression. With the development of LIDAR sensors on phones, the measurement of the surrounding environment will be faster and more precise, resulting in the greatest user experience (Jessica Canning - 26 March 2021).
            <br><br>
            + The app will initially run with English and Chinese audio readout; however, in order to extend the market, it will be expanded to include many other languages such as Vietnamese, Japanese, and so on.
            <br><br>
            + After completing the app, I will solicit feedback from friends and family to delete or add certain adjustments to produce the most user-friendly platforms. Furthermore, when my app is operating, I am looking for consumersâ€™ responses in order to make updates and maintain the program to guarantee that there are no malfunctions or troubles encountered.
            <br><br>
